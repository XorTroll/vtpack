# vtpack

`vtpack` is a simple Rust library for reading/extracting "vtPack" format files.

This format doesn't seem to be documented anywhere. The only usage of this format (that I know of) is the main asset file of `Torrente 3: The Protector`.

## Usage

Check the [example](vtpack/examples/torrente3.rs).
